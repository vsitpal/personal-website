  content: |-
    Predominantly a (Computer) Systems developer, but more importantly a human.
    I am a post-graduate from Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh) specialising in Computer Systems & Security with basic knowledge of Machine Learning and Business Management. I'm mainly interested in Operating systems, Storage systems, Networks and Distributed systems research and development. My long term plan is to contribute to open-source projects and be an active part of the OSS community.
