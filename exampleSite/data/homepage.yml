Hello! I’m Vikram!
I’m a systems developer, but I’m more interested in understanding the underlying principles that make systems tick than in the code itself. My work often involves delving into complex technical challenges, and I enjoy the process of breaking things down and finding elegant solutions.

I have a master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh), where I concentrated on Computer Systems & Security, with a side interest in Machine Learning and Business Management. I focus primarily on Operating Systems, Storage Systems, Computer Architecture, Networking, and Distributed Systems. Over the years, I’ve also gained experience in Embedded Systems. More recently, I’ve been exploring database systems and language models; and the deeper I go, the more fascinating it becomes.

At the moment, I’m a Database Kernel Developer at Oracle, working in the Virtual Operating Systems team in Redwood Shores.

Looking ahead, I plan to contribute to open-source projects and be involved in the broader open-source ecosystem—where collaboration and transparency drive innovation.

If you’d like to discuss systems development, aircraft, hiking, ships, submarines, or bimmers, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to a good conversation!
