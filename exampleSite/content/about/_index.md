### Introduction

As you may have already gathered, I am an eager and driven computer systems developer with a focus on operating systems, storage systems, computer architecture, networking, and distributed systems. I‚Äôve also gained experience working with embedded systems.

Recently, I‚Äôve been diving into the world of database systems, and it has been an exciting exploration. Currently, I work on Oracle‚Äôs RDBMS kernel, where I continue to hone my expertise.

Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to contribute to open-source projects and actively engage with the open-source software community.

`Love systems development, aircrafts and bimmers.`

### Personal

In my free time, I enjoy reading spy-fiction and philosophical novels. I like listening to (specific) music, running, hiking, travelling (by car), bodyweight exercises, playing squash, watching documentaries, reading about aircrafts (fighters), warships and submarines. I love aircrafts. I thoroughly enjoy reading books on Unix programming (design philosophy), kernel programming and anything which I find interesting in the tech world!

I also enjoy reading about birds and plants, and once in a while take a shot at photography.

`Also, did I say that already? I love aircrafts. And computer systems.`

### Family

To respect my family's privacy, I prefer not to share specific details about them. However, I would like to express how truly blessed I feel to have such a wonderful and loving family.


### Spirituality

I am not a religious person, but I do consider myself spiritual. I am a part of a spiritual mission called [Heartfulness (SRCM)](https://heartfulness.org/en/) where there is no religion, just a notion that "*Humanity‚Äôs way forward is through the heart*". And we meditate.

I am very fortunate to have my Guide, my Master, whom we lovingly call *Daaji* (Kamlesh D. Patel) supporting and guiding us through all phases of life, both *materialistic and spiritual*, and I consider him a part of my family. üôÇ

While I am not very religious, I embrace a spiritual path that enriches my life. I‚Äôm a humble member of the [Heartfulness (SRCM)](https://heartfulness.org/en/) community, where our guiding principle is simple yet profound: ‚ÄúHumanity‚Äôs way forward is through the heart.‚Äù Central to this journey is our practice of meditation.

I feel incredibly grateful to have my guide and guru, affectionately known as Daaji (Kamlesh D. Patel), who offers unwavering support and wisdom through every stage of life‚Äîboth material and spiritual.
