I am a post-graduate from CMU (Pittsburgh) specialising in Computer Systems and computer security with basic knowledge of machine learning. Iâ€™m mainly interested in operating systems, storage systems, networks and distributed systems research and development. My long term plan (in action) is to contribute to open-source projects and be an active part of the OSS community.

In my free time, I enjoy reading spy-fiction and philosophical novels. I like listening to (specific) music, running, hiking, travelling, bodyweight exercises, playing squash, watching documentaries, reading about aircrafts (fighters), warships and submarines. I love aircrafts. I thoroughly enjoy reading books on Unix programming (design philosophy), kernel programming and anything which I find interesting in the tech world!

I also enjoy reading about birds and plants, and once in a while take a shot at photography.
