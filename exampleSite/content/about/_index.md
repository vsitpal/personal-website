### Introduction

As you may have already gathered, I am an eager and driven computer systems developer with a focus on operating systems, storage systems, computer architecture, networking, and distributed systems. Iâ€™ve also gained experience working with embedded systems.

Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into the world of database systems, and it has been an exciting exploration. Currently, I work on Oracleâ€™s RDBMS kernel, where I continue to hone my expertise.

Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to contribute to open-source projects and actively engage with the open-source software community.

`Love systems development, aircrafts and bimmers.`

### Personal

In my free time, I enjoy reading spy-fiction and philosophical novels. I like listening to (specific) music, running, hiking, travelling (by car), bodyweight exercises, playing squash, watching documentaries, reading about aircrafts (fighters), warships and submarines. I love aircrafts. I thoroughly enjoy reading books on Unix programming (design philosophy), kernel programming and anything which I find interesting in the tech world!

I also enjoy reading about birds and plants, and once in a while take a shot at photography.

`Also, did I say that already? I love aircrafts. And computer systems.`

### Family

Without violating too much of our privacy, I am very blessed to have the best and most loving family.
Here are a few words about them.

> I come from a family of post-graduates.

I am a part of a spiritual mission called [Heartfulness (SRCM)](https://heartfulness.org/en/) where there is no religion, just a notion that "*Humanityâ€™s way forward is through the heart*". And we meditate.

I am very fortunate to have my Guide, my Master, whom we lovingly call *Daaji* (Kamlesh D. Patel) supporting and guiding us through all phases of life, both *materialistic and spiritual*, and I consider him a part of my family. ðŸ™‚
