### Introduction

As you already might have read, I am a post-graduate from CMU (Pittsburgh) specialising in Computer Systems & Security, Iâ€™m mainly interested in operating systems, storage systems, networks and distributed systems research and development. 
My long term plan (in action) is to contribute to open-source projects and be an active part of the OSS community.

### Personal

In my free time, I enjoy reading spy-fiction and philosophical novels. I like listening to (specific) music, running, hiking, travelling, bodyweight exercises, playing squash, watching documentaries, reading about aircrafts (fighters), warships and submarines. I love aircrafts. I thoroughly enjoy reading books on Unix programming (design philosophy), kernel programming and anything which I find interesting in the tech world!

I also enjoy reading about birds and plants, and once in a while take a shot at photography.

`Also, did say that already? I love aircrafts.`

### Family

Without giving away too much of our privacy, I am very blessed to have the best and the most loving family.

> I come from a family of post-graduates. ðŸ™‚

My handsome and super-intelligent father is an officer in the Indian Air Force, an aerospace engineer and a one-star general, so that makes me a *military kid*. I like to call him *Baapu*, the best solider of my nation. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

My sweet, caring and (*the most*) beautiful *Maa* is a homemaker by *profession* and figurately, the backbone of my family.

My affectionate elder sister is a certified yoga trainer, an engineer, an MBA and loving mother of my cute, newborn niece (and sometimes mine) who is currently taking a break from work but *on-duty* 24x7.

My adventerous brother-in-law is also an officer in the Indian Air Force, an electrical engineer and a parajumper.

I am a part of a spiritual mission called [Heartfulness](https://heartfulness.org/en/) where there is no religion, just a notion that "*Humanityâ€™s way forward
is through the heart*". And we meditate.

I am very fortunate to have my Guide, my Master, whom we lovingly call *Daaji* (Kamlesh D. Patel) supporting and guiding us through all phases of life, both *materialistic and spiritual*, and I consider Him a part of my family. ðŸ™‚
