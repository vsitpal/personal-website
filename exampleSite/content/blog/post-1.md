# My Journey at Carnegie Mellon University: A Tale of Growth, Challenges, and Love

As I reflect on my time at Carnegie Mellon University’s Information Networking Institute (INI), I am filled with a sense of pride and nostalgia. My journey was not just about academics; it was a unique blend of experiences that shaped my personal and professional identity.

## The Balance of Soft and Technical Skills

Looking back, my undergraduate experience was heavily focused on soft skills because I was more interested in hanging out with my boys and trying my best to flirt with my future wife AKA my college sweet heart, while CMU was all about technical upskilling. This balance was essential in shaping who I am today. I learned the value of teamwork and networking, skills that are indispensable in the tech world from my UG at VIT, and CMU pushed me out of my comfort zone, into deep introspection and a new experience I would not replace with much else.

## A Love for CMU’s older buildings

One of the things I really liked was the architecture of CMU's old buildings (mostly around the Mall) like Hamburg Hall, Baker, Hamerschlag and Doherty Halls. The old buildings exuded charm and history, providing a beautiful backdrop to my studies. Each structure seemed to tell a story, and I often found myself inspired by the blend of tradition and innovation that characterized the campus.

## Specializing in Systems Programming

Highlight of my CMU experience was my decision to specialize in systems programming. Diving deep into the complexities of software and hardware interactions not only enhanced my technical skills but also ignited a passion for problem-solving and some revelations. The rigorous coursework challenged me to think critically and innovate, which was incredibly rewarding. I often found myself lost in code, but every breakthrough brought a sense of accomplishment that made it all worthwhile.

## A Diverse Academic Experience

In addition to my systems programming focus, I took courses in machine learning and business. This blend of disciplines was instrumental in expanding my perspective. The machine learning classes opened my eyes to the incredible possibilities of data, while the business courses taught me the importance of understanding the market dynamics behind technological advancements. It was a powerful combination that prepared me for a multifaceted career in tech.


## Cherished Moments in Schenley Park

Amidst the rigorous academic schedule, I cherished the moments spent with my future wife. Our walks in Schenley Park and Murray Ave became a highlight of our time at CMU (yes she was with my at CMU also). The beauty of the park, combined with the company of someone special, provided a perfect escape from the demands of coursework. Those leisurely strolls were not just a break; they were moments of connection and joy that I will always treasure.


## Facing Adversity: COVID-19

As I approached my final semester, I encountered an unexpected challenge: COVID-19. I fell ill and had to return home to India for two months. This period was both difficult and enlightening. While being away and unable to work much was tough, it offered me time to reflect and recharge. I had to adapt to a new normal, and in many ways, it became a lesson in resilience. I managed to stay on track with my studies remotely, and I learned that persistence and adaptability are crucial in life.


## Graduating with Honors

Despite the setbacks, I graduated with a commendable GPA and received two awards that recognized my hard work and dedication. These achievements were a testament to my family, the supportive professors and staff at CMU, who encouraged me to strive for excellence even in challenging times. I am proud to be a Tartan, knowing that I was part of an institution that values hard work and innovation.


## Tartan Proud

As I conclude this reflection, I cannot help but express how proud I am to be a Tartan. My time at Carnegie Mellon was a transformative experience that equipped me with the tools to thrive in today’s fast-paced environment. I am excited to take the lessons I’ve learned into the future, and I will always carry the spirit of CMU with me.

In every challenge I faced and every success I celebrated, my family was the foundation that supported me, and for that, I am eternally grateful. So here’s to them, past, present, and future!
