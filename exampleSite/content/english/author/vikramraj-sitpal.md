I am about to graduate from CMU (Pittsburgh) specialising in Computer Systems and computer security with basic knowledge of machine learning. I'll soon be joining Oracle's Virtual OS team as SMTS.  
  
I'm mainly interested in operating systems, storage systems, networks and distributed systems.  
  
Long-term plan: Contribute to open-source projects and be an active part of the OSS community.  
  
In my free time, I enjoy reading spy-fiction and philosophical novels. I like listening to (specific) music, running, bodyweight exercises, playing squash, watching documentaries, reading about aircrafts (fighters), warships and submarines. I thoroughly enjoy reading books on Unix programming (design philosophy), kernel programming and anything which I find interesting in the tech world!
